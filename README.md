# Australian Driving Guidelines

A simple app for looking at medical guidelines for assessing fitness to drive in Australia.

The data in these guidelines is referenced from the Austroads Assessing Fitness to Drive Guidelines (2017). This app and its author are in no way affiliated with Austroads or the authors of that guideline.

The goal of this app is to provide a convenient quick reference to the specific medical standards outlined in that guidelines. It does not attempt to capture all of the nuance and detail of the full guidelines. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with the full document before undertaking driving assessments.

I have tried to be as accurate as possible with the guidance provided in this app. If you notice any discrepencies between my app and the official guidelines please let me know.
