note: >
    Audiometry is not required if initial clinical assessment does not suggest significant hearing loss. Where there does appear to be significant hearing loss then audiometry should be performed. If significant hearing loss is insufficiently corrected by a hearing aid the a conditional licence may be considered by the licencing authority based on the nature of the driving task, information provided by the specialist or audiologist, and the practical driver assessment if required.
