        criteria:
            - Minimal symptoms relevant to driving
            - Exercise tolerance >90% prediced on stress test
            - No evidence severe ischaemia on stress test (see below)
            - No severe stenoses (>70% or >50% LM) on coronary angiography
              (see below)
            - Left ventricular EF > 40% (see below)
note: >
    For commercial licenses, if there is no ischaemia on stress test then an
    angiogram is not required and the EF does not need to be considered. If
    angiography does not show any severe stenoses then the EF does not need to
    be considered. The full list of criteria apply where angiography shows
    severe non-LM stenosis. In all cases, if revascularisation has occured
    refer also to the guidelines on PCI or CABG.
